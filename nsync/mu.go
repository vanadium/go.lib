// The nsync package provides a mutex Mu and a Mesa-style condition variable CV.
//
// The nsync primitives differ from those in sync in that nsync provides
// timed/cancellable wait on CV, and try-lock on Mu; CV's wait primitives take
// the mutex as an explicit argument to remind the reader that they have a side
// effect on the mutex; the zero value CV can be used without further
// initialization; and Mu forbids a lock acquired by one thread to be released
// by another.
//
// As well as Mu and CV being usable with one another, an nsync,Mu can be used
// with a sync.Cond, and an nsync.CV can be used with a sync.Mutex.
package nsync

import "sync/atomic"

// Implementation notes
//
// The implementation of Mu and CV both use spinlocks to protect their waiter
// queues.  The spinlocks are implemented with atomic operations and a delay
// loop found in common.go.  They could use sync.Mutex, but I wished to have an
// implementation independent of the sync package (except for the trivial use
// of the sync.Locker interface.
//
// Mu and CV use the same type of doubly-linked list of waiters (see
// waiter.go).  This allows waiters to be transferred from the CV queue to the
// Mu queue when a thread is logically woken from the CV but would immediately
// go to sleep on the Mu.  See the wakeWaiters() call in cv.go.
//
// In Mu, the "designated waker" is a thread that was waiting on Mu, has been
// woken up, but as yet has neither acquired nor gone back to waiting.  The
// presence of such a thread is indicated by the muDesigWaker bit in the Mu
// word.  This bit allows the Unlock() code to avoid waking a second waiter
// when there's already one will wake the next thread when the time comes.
// This speeds things up when the lock is heavily contended, and the critical
// sections are small.
//
// The weasel words "with high probability" in the specification of TryLock()
// prevent clients from believing that they can determine with certainty
// whether another thread has given up a lock yet.  This, together with the
// requirement that a thread that acquired a mutex must release it (rather than
// it being released by another thread), prohibits clients from using Mu as a
// sort of semaphore.  The intent is that it be used only for traditional
// mutual exclusion.  This leaves room for certain future optimizations, and
// make it easier to apply detection of potential races via candidate lock-set
// algorithms, should that ever be desired.
//
// The condition variable has a wait with an absolute rather than a relative
// timeout.  This is less error prone, as described in the comment on
// CV.WaitWithDeadline().  Alas, relative timeouts are seductive in trivial
// examples (such as tests).  These are the first things that people try, so
// they are likely to be requested.  If enough people complain we could give
// them that particular piece of rope.
//
// The condition variable uses an internal binary semaphore that is passed a
// *time.Timer stored in a *waiter for its expirations.  It is as invariant
// that the timer is inactive and its channel drained when the waiter is on the
// waiter free list.

// A Mu is a mutex.  Its zero value is valid, and unlocked.
// It is similar to sync.Mutex, but implements TryLock().
//
// A Mu can be "free", or held by a single thread (aka goroutine).  A thread
// that acquires it should eventually release it.  It is not legal to acquire a
// Mu in one thread and release it in another.
//
// Example usage, where p.mu is an nsync.Mu protecting the invariant p.a+p.b==0
//
//	p.mu.Lock()
//	// The current thread now has exclusive access to p.a and p.b; invariant assumed true.
//	p.a++
//	p.b-- // restore invariant p.a+p.b==0 before releasing p.mu
//	p.mu.Unlock()
