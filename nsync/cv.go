// See also the implementation notes at the top of mu.go.

// A CV is a condition variable in the style of Mesa, Java, POSIX, and Go's sync.Cond.
// It allows a thread to wait for a condition on state protected by a mutex,
// and to proceed with the mutex held and the condition true.
//
// When compared with sync.Cond:  (a) CV adds WaitWithDeadline() which allows
// timeouts and cancellation, (b) the mutex is an explicit argument of the wait
// calls to remind the reader that they have a side-effect on the mutex, and
// (c) (as a result of (b)), a zero-valued CV is a valid CV with no enqueued
// waiters, so there is no need of a call to construct a CV.
//
// Usage:
//
// After making the desired predicate true, call:
//     cv.Signal() // If at most one thread can make use of the predicate becoming true.
// or
//     cv.Broadcast() // If multiple threads can make use of the predicate becoming true.
//
// To wait for a predicate with no deadline (assuming cv.Broadcast() is called
// whenever the predicate becomes true):
//      mu.Lock()
//      for !some_predicate_protected_by_mu { // the for-loop is required.
//              cv.Wait(&mu)
//      }
//      // predicate is now true
//      mu.Unlock()
//
// To wait for a predicate with a deadline (assuming cv.Broadcast() is called
// whenever the predicate becomes true):
//      mu.Lock()
//      for !some_predicate_protected_by_mu && cv.WaitWithDeadline(&mu, absDeadline, cancelChan) == nsync.OK {
//      }
//      if some_predicate_protected_by_mu { // predicate is true
//      } else { // predicate is false, and deadline expired, or cancelChan was closed.
//      }
//      mu.Unlock()
// or, if the predicate is complex and you wish to write it just once and
// inline, you could use the following instead of the for-loop above:
//      mu.Lock()
//      var predIsTrue bool
//      for outcome := OK; ; outcome = cv.WaitWithDeadline(&mu, absDeadline, cancelChan) {
//              if predIsTrue = some_predicate_protected_by_mu; predIsTrue || outcome != nsync.OK {
//                      break
//              }
//      }
//      if predIsTrue { // predicate is true
//      } else { // predicate is false, and deadline expired, or cancelChan was closed.
//      }
//      mu.Unlock()
//
// As the examples show, Mesa-style condition variables require that waits use
// a loop that tests the predicate anew after each wait.  It may be surprising
// that these are preferred over the precise wakeups offered by the condition
// variables in Hoare monitors.  Imprecise wakeups make more efficient use of
// the critical section, because threads can enter it while a woken thread is
// still emerging from the scheduler, which may take thousands of cycles.
// Further, they make the programme easier to read and debug by making the
// predicate explicit locally at the wait, where the predicate is about to be
// assumed; the reader does not have to infer the predicate by examining all
// the places where wakeups may occur.

// WaitWithDeadline() atomically releases "mu" and blocks the calling thread on
// *cv.  It then waits until awakened by a call to Signal() or Broadcast() (or
// a spurious wakeup), or by the time reaching absDeadline, or by cancelChan

// absDeadline==nsync.NoDeadline for no deadline, and cancelChan==nil for no
// cancellation.  WaitWithDeadline() should be used in a loop, as with all
// Mesa-style condition variables.  See examples above.
//
// There are two reasons for using an absolute deadline, rather than a relative
// timeout---these are why pthread_cond_timedwait() also uses an absolute
// deadline.  First, condition variable waits have to be used in a loop; with
// an absolute times, the deadline does not have to be recomputed on each
// iteration.  Second, in most real programmes, some activity (such as an RPC
// to a server, or when guaranteeing response time in a UI), there is a
// deadline imposed by the specification or the caller/user; relative delays
// can shift arbitrarily with scheduling delays, and so after multiple waits
// might extend beyond the expected deadline.  Relative delays tend to be more
// convenient mostly in tests and trivial examples than they are in real
// programmes.
