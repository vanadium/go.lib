Command linewrap formats text from stdin into pretty output on stdout.

The input text is expected to consist of words, defined as sequences of letters.
Sequences of words form paragraphs, where paragraphs are separated by either
blank lines (that contain no letters), or an explicit U+2029 ParagraphSeparator.
Input lines with leading spaces are treated verbatim.

Paragraphs are output as word-wrapped lines; line breaks only occur at word
boundaries.  Output lines are usually no longer than the target width,
defaulting to the terminal width.  The exceptions are single words longer than
the target width, which are output on their own line, and verbatim lines, which
may be arbitrarily longer or shorter than the width.

Output lines never contain trailing spaces.  Only verbatim output lines may
contain leading spaces.  Spaces separating input words are output verbatim,
unless it would result in a line with leading or trailing spaces.

Example usage in a unix terminal:
  $ cat myfile.txt | linewrap

See http://godoc.org/v.io/x/lib/textutil#WrapWriter for details on the
formatting algorithm.

Usage:
   linewrap [flags]

The linewrap flags are:
 -indents=
   Comma-separated indentation prefixes.  Each entry specifes the prefix to use
   for the corresponding paragraph line, or all subsequent paragraph lines if
   there are no more entries.  E.g. "AA,BBB,C" means the first line in each
   paragraph is indented with "AA", the second line with "BBB", and all
   subsequent lines with "C".  The format of each indent prefix is a Go
   interpreted string literal.
      https://golang.org/ref/spec#String_literals
 -line-term=\n
   Line terminator.  Every output line is terminated with this string.  The
   format is a Go interpreted string literal, where \n means newline.
      https://golang.org/ref/spec#String_literals
 -para-sep=\n
   Paragraph separator.  Every consecutive pair of non-empty paragraphs is
   separated with this string.  The format is a Go interpreted string literal,
   where \n menas newline.
      https://golang.org/ref/spec#String_literals
 -width=<terminal width>
   Target line width in runes.  If negative the line width is unlimited; each
   paragraph is output as a single line.  If 0 each word is output on its own
   line. Defaults to the terminal width.

The global flags are:
 -metadata=<just specify -metadata to activate>
   Displays metadata for the program and exits.
 -time=false
   Dump timing information to stderr before exiting the program.
