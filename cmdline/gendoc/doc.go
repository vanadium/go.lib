Usage of gendoc:

	-build-cmd string
	  	Comand to use for building/installing commands whose usage is to be documented, it must accept the same flags as 'go install'.
	-copyright-notice string
	  	File containing the copyright notice to be prepended to the autogenerated documentation; if specified as an empty string then no copyright notice will be used.
	-env string
	  	Environment variables to set before running command.  If "os", grabs vars from the underlying OS.  If empty, doesn't set any vars.  Otherwise vars are expected to be comma-separated entries of the form KEY1=VALUE1,KEY2=VALUE2,... (default "os")
	-go-flag-pkg
	  	Set if the command is using the standard go flag package, it sets both use-stderr and postprocess-output to true
	-install string
	  	Comma separated list of packages to install before running command.  All commands that are built will be on the PATH.
	-out string
	  	Path to the output file. (default "./doc.go")
	-postprocess-output
	  	If set, the help/usage output will be post processed to remove absolute path names that contain the build directory.
	-tags string
	  	Tags for go build, also added as build constraints in the generated output file.
	-use-stderr
	  	If set, read usage output from stderr rather than stdout; it also ignores the exit status of the command.
